# Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Site Published Successfully!

Your site has been deployed to GitHub Pages and is now live!

### ✅ Recent Fix Applied
**Issue Resolved**: Fixed CSS and JavaScript loading problems on the live site.
- **Problem**: Site was displaying as plain HTML without styling due to incorrect asset paths
- **Solution**: Added proper `base: '/ltab_duplicate_1/'` configuration to vite.config.js
- **Result**: All CSS, JavaScript, and image assets now load correctly with proper GitHub Pages paths

## 📍 Live URL
**Your site is accessible at**: https://ltabai002-ai.github.io/ltab_duplicate_1/

## 🛠️ Deployment Details

### GitHub Pages Setup
- **Branch**: `gh-pages` (automatically deployed)
- **Source**: Static files from `dist` folder
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (Vite build)
- **Output Directory**: `dist/`

### How It Works
1. The site is built using Vite with proper base URL (`npm run build`)
2. Built files are placed in the `dist/` directory with correct `/ltab_duplicate_1/` asset paths
3. Static files are deployed to the `gh-pages` branch
4. GitHub Pages serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch
5. All CSS, JavaScript, and image assets load correctly with proper paths

## 🔄 Future Updates

To update the deployed site:

1. Make changes to your source code
2. Build the project: `npm run build` (automatically uses correct base URL)
3. Deploy updated files to the `gh-pages` branch
4. GitHub Pages will automatically update the live site

### Manual Deployment Script
You can create a deployment script for future updates:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Build the project with correct base URL
npm run build

# Create temporary backup of build
cp -r dist /tmp/gh-pages-build

# Switch to gh-pages branch and update
git checkout gh-pages
find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name '.git' ! -name '.' -exec rm -rf {} \;
cp -r /tmp/gh-pages-build/* .
rm -rf /tmp/gh-pages-build
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy updated site"
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout main
```

### ⚠️ Important Configuration
The `vite.config.js` file **must** include the correct base URL:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/ltab_duplicate_1/',  // This is critical for GitHub Pages!
  // ... other config
});
```
